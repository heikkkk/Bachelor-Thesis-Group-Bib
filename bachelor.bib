  abstract = {Cross-platform mobile development frameworks are a popular way to create mobile apps these days. Two popular options are React Native and Expo, which offer slightly different ways to create Android and iOS apps using React. Expo provides an abstraction layer on top of React Native, enabling a better developer experience and simpler process.    This work compares the features, advantages and disadvantages of popular cross-platform mobile development frameworks React Native and Expo. Their abilities and suitability for various projects are evaluated and it is determined whether Expo can be considered a better option in certain situations. The results of the work show that although Expo offers many advantages, its suitability for a specific project depends on the specific requirements and needs of the project, but today the features it offers are sufficient and more straightforward for many projects.},

The purpose of the ℡NET Protocol is to provide a fairly general, bi-directional, eight-bit byte oriented communications facility. Its primary goal is to allow a standard method of interfacing terminal devices and terminal-oriented processes to each other. It is envisioned that the protocol may also be used for terminal-terminal communication ("linking") and process-process communication (distributed computation). This RFC specifies a standard for the ARPA Internet community. Hosts on the ARPA Internet are expected to adopt and implement this standard. Obsoletes NIC 18639.},
